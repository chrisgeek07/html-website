    <p>Hiking is an outdoor activity which consists of walking in natural environments, often in mountainous or other scenic
        terrain. People often hike on hiking trails. It is such a popular activity that there are numerous hiking
        organizations worldwide. Studies have confirmed the health benefits of different types of hiking, including losing
        excess weight, decreasing hypertension, and improving mental health. The word hiking is understood in all
        English-speaking countries, but there are differences in usage.

        I've been doing hikes for over 15 years and always enjoyed it. I simply love spending time in nature, there are 
        always new trails to discover and it is also a way for me go get away from screens and recharge my batteries.
