    <p>"I think music in itself is healing. It's an explosive expression of humanity. It's something we are all touched by.
        No matter what culture we're from, everyone loves music."
        <br>
        <strong>Billy Joel</strong>

    <p>Music has always been part of my life since I was a kid. I heard a friend playing a song called "Tears in heaven"
        on guitar when I was in high school, at this moment I said I need to learn how to play that instrument.
        So I took guitar lessons, after that went to music school and to that day I still play music and it still plays
        a huge role in my everyday life.
