    <h1>Trail Running</h1>

    <p>Trail running is simply defined as going for a run in the heart of nature. It's an extremely all-round non-stadia
        sport that, of course, works the legs, but also the upper body. Lastly, it requires concentration and attention.
        You don't need to be high in the mountains to go trail running. You simply need to be in nature.

        As an outdoor sports enthusiast trail running is something that I wanted to start a long time ago, but I was always 
        busy with work or other responsibilities. So last year is when I really started training and participating in races.
        I really enjoy running in nature and it was also a way of challenging myself, going out of my comfort zone and pushing
        my limits.
